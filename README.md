## 📋 About

**Music Universe** is a full-stack music streaming web application. Users can sign up, log in, browse and
search songs and artists, listen to tracks through a built-in player, like songs, subscribe to artists,
and explore charts, featured tracks, and personalized "For You" recommendations.

The project was built for the *Advanced Databases* course, with a focus on the **graph database Neo4j** —
modeling entities (songs, artists, albums, users) as nodes and the relationships between them as edges,
and querying that graph through Cypher via a REST API. A **Redis** layer is used for caching, and
authentication is handled with **JWT** tokens.

## ✨ Features

- User **sign up / login** with **JWT** authentication
- **Browse and search** songs and artists
- Built-in **music player** (play, play count tracking)
- **Like** songs and **subscribe / unsubscribe** to artists
- **Charts** (top songs), **Featured**, and personalized **"For You"** sections
- **Artist pages** with biography, stats, songs, and most popular tracks
- Add new **songs, albums, artists, and songwriters**
- **Redis caching** for faster repeated reads
- Auto-generated **Swagger** API documentation

## 🛠️ Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React 18, React Router 6, Material UI (MUI) 5 |
| Backend | ASP.NET Core 5.0 Web API (C#) |
| Database | Neo4j (graph database, via Neo4jClient / Bolt) |
| Cache | Redis (StackExchange.Redis + ServiceStack.Redis) |
| Auth | JWT (JSON Web Tokens) |
| API docs | Swagger / Swashbuckle |

```

The backend is organized into **Controllers** (REST endpoints), **Services** (caching), and **Auth**
(JWT issuing/validation), with **Models** describing the graph entities.

## 🗃️ Data model (graph entities)

Entities are stored as nodes in Neo4j and connected by relationships:

- **User** — username, email, password; likes songs and subscribes to artists
- **Song** — title, lyrics, year, genre, audio file, image, stream count
- **Singer** — name, birthplace, birthday, biography
- **Songwriter** — name; writes songs
- **Album** — title, year, cover
- **Rating** — a like relationship between a user and a song

Typical relationships include *user → likes → song*, *user → subscribes → singer*,
*singer → performs → song*, *songwriter → wrote → song*, and *song → belongs to → album*.

## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14+) and npm
- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/) running locally on `bolt://localhost:7687`
- [Redis](https://redis.io/download) running locally on `localhost:6379`

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jovanasss/Music-Universe.git
cd Music-Universe
```

### 2. Configure the databases

- Make sure **Neo4j** and **Redis** are running.
- The Neo4j connection (URI and credentials) is configured in `backend/Startup.cs`
  (default `bolt://localhost:7687`, user `neo4j`). Update the password there to match your local instance.
- The Redis connection string is in `backend/appsettings.json` (`"RedisConnection": "localhost:6379"`).

### 3. Run the backend

```bash
cd backend
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

The API runs at `https://localhost:5001`, with Swagger UI at `https://localhost:5001/swagger`.
CORS is already configured to allow the React app on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Run the frontend

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:3000` and proxies API requests to `https://localhost:5001`
(configured via the `proxy` field in `package.json`).
